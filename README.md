# hodolhat: Sample Hardhat Project (in Klaytn Network)

> Advanced Sample [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat) Project **compatible with Klaytn Network**. Modified with libraries from [Kokoa Finance](https://github.com/kokoa-finance).

- Node.js: v16.14.0
- Hardhat CLI: v2.9.0

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn compile
yarn run:node
yarn deploy
yarn deploy:baobab
yarn deploy:cypress
yarn clean
yarn test
yarn lint
yarn lint:sol
yarn hardhat accounts
yarn hardhat run scripts/tutorial.ts
```
